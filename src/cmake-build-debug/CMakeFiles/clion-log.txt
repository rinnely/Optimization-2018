CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgdal.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gdal", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gdal" with any of
  the following names:

    gdalConfig.cmake
    gdal-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gdal" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gdal_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gdal"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
